Leonardo da Vinci (15 April 1452 â€“ 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was active 
as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect.
While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he has also become known for his notebooks, 
in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, 
painting, and paleontology. Leonardo epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal, and his collective works comprise 
a contribution to later generations of artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary Michelangelo.
